#3 Differential gene expression analysis will be carried out for 4079 protein-coding genes in the S. Paratyphi A genome. For 4079 genes with an average count of 100, dispersion 0.1 and of which 80% do not change, 19 samples are sufficient to achieve 80% power to detect a fold change of 1.5 with false discovery rate 0.05 (ssizeRNA package).
